# Simplified ROS install script

This script is kinda forked from [this very repository](https://github.com/oroca/oroca-ros-pkg)
and modified to be more generalized script. _Special thanks to fellas in Oroca_. This script is
also refered in [this ros wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation/TwoLineInstall) as
**two line install**.
